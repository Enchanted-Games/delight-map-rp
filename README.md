# Delight-map
Delight-map is a resourcepack that tweaks Minecraft's lighting to be slightly darker and a bit more realistic. The name is a play on the word "lightmap"

This pack was designed for 25-35% brightness, so it is recommended to change your brightness setting to about 30%.

## Mod compatibility
This pack will work in vanilla or with sodium, with no additional mods required!

It likely won't work with optifine or iris

## What exactly does it do?
- Block light (from things like torches) is now warmer (more orange) and spreads slightly less
- Sky light is cooler (more blue) and spreads much less than it does in vanilla. This means shaded areas look darker as if they were actually in shadow
- The overall brightness has been decreased (dont worry you can still crank the brightness to 100% if you really like seeing in caves)
- Lighting in the end is a bit warmer and isnt an off-green like it is in vanilla
